| TIP-221 | Change referral rewards | Draft | holmberg | Switch referrals reward system to whitelist only | discordlink | 2024-08-06

## Simple Summary
Change the referral reward system to whitelist. 

## Motivation
Majority of referrals are self-referrals and the referral system has been negative for protocol. 

## Specification
I suggest switching the referral system to whitelist only. The referral system review has shown that 80% of the volume is self-referral and it does not benefit the protocol. 


~~Referral reward is paid currently from winning and losing positions. In small risk positions where implied probability is >95%, the referral effect is from 10% to 50%. There might be a chance for abuse use.
I suggest that referral reward be paid only for lost positions in all Thales products. This is closer to the industry standard and eliminates the possibility of abusive use.
However, for the referral fees to remain attractive and at the same level, the basic level must be raised to 1%.~~
