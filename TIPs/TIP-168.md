| TIP-168 | SafeBox fee on positive Vault rounds | Draft | milkywave (milkywave_) |This TIP proposes that 20% from each positive round on a Vault will be sent to SafeBox | https://discord.gg/XXXXX | 2023-09-01

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes that 20% from each positive round on a Vault will be sent to SafeBox

 ## Motivation
The vaults have been running for some time now and the liquidity providers are enjoying high returns on stablecoins in most of the vaults. Since the implementation of TIP-105, the SB fee has been reduced to 0.5% (from 3%)  when Vaults are buying from Thales or Overtime AMMs in order to create an incentive to deposit liquidity in vaults (which means a four times lower SB fee compared to a conventional trade which has a SB Fee of 2%). In addition, this Thales product has not charged any service fee so far. 
To push the SafeBox earnings (and the related burn) further, this TIP proposes that 20% of each positive round on a Vault goes to SafeBox. With this TIP implemented we would have the same system for liquidity providers in the whole Thales Ecosystem (already introduced for LP's with TIP-163).

  - Thales AMM Vaults:
    - Discount Vault: +22.98% (OP) / +3.96% (ARB)
