| TIP-43 | Modification of THALES token LP program | Draft | BigPlutus (@BigPenny)| Modification of THALES token LP program | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-04-16
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to revert the reduction of the LP staking rewards introduced by TIP-41.
 
## Abstract
 
The reduction of THALES rewards towards THALES/WETH G-UNI LP token stakers, from 50,000 to 30,000 THALES tokens weekly has resulted in the APY for Stakers outperforming the APY for liquidity providers. Considering that liquidity providers subject themselves to risk of impermanent loss, their rewards should not be lower than those of a secure single sided staking pool.

The idea of TIP-41 was to taper down LP reward while ramping up the bonds program, giving a stronger emphasis on bonds, however there is no need to reduce the LP incentives to achieve this goal.

This TIP proposes to reinstate the 50,000 THALES tokens rewards for the THALES/WETH G-UNI LP token stakers, starting on 22nd of April, 2022. The program will end according to the orginal schedule of TIP-41, namely the 13th of May, 2022.
 
 
## Specification
 
  - This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to increase THALES rewards towards THALES/WETH G-UNI LP token stakers, from 30,000 to 50,000 THALES tokens weekly for 3 weeks starting from 22nd of April.
