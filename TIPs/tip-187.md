## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes the introduction of Escrowed Thales (esThales) rewards for Thales protocol users, replacing the current staking rewards system. This change aims to promote long-term holding and contribute to Thales' deflationary tokenomics.

## Motivation
THALES staking has been instrumental in Thales DAO governance and token distribution. However, recent community feedback and evolving DeFi dynamics suggest a need for a more sustainable and deflationary approach.

## Specification
Introduction of Escrowed Thales (esThales):
- esThales will be rewarded to users staking THALES, replacing the current staking rewards.
- esThales can be staked for additional rewards or vested over a fixed period (e.g., one year) to convert into actual THALES tokens.

Compounding and Claiming Options:
- Users can choose to either compound their esThales (re-stake for additional rewards) or claim them (transfer to their wallet).

Vesting Mechanism:
- esThales tokens can be converted to THALES through a vesting process, enhancing long-term holding incentives.
- Vesting esThales will not earn additional rewards during the vesting period.

Impact on Tokenomics:
- This model is expected to reduce the circulating supply of THALES, aiding in creating deflationary pressure.
- The vesting and staking mechanisms should encourage users to hold and engage with the THALES token for longer periods.

Implementation Across Chains:
- The esThales system will be implemented across all chains where Thales is present: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Base.

Deprecation of Current Staking Rewards:
- Existing staking rewards in THALES will be fully deprecated in favor of the esThales model.

## Rationale
The shift towards an escrowed reward system is expected to align with Thales' long-term vision of a sustainable and robust tokenomics model. It encourages long-term participation and investment in the ecosystem, potentially leading to a more stable and growing market value for THALES.
