| TIP-167 | Kickstart Aeorodrome Bribes on BASE | Draft | cyberduck (@acyberduck) | This TIP proposes a one off bribe to Thales USDbC and ETH pair pools on Aerodrome | https://discord.gg/8bzFdpGTrp | 2023-08-30
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes a one off bribe to Thales USDbC and ETH pair pools on Aerodrome on BASE network with 5,000 Thales for each pair for the first epoch ending at 00:00 31st August 2023. 
 
 ## Motivation

Thales has been granted the partner status for Aerodrome's release on BASE network. With this in mind and with Thales' intent on growing its protocol presence on BASE, being amonst the first protocols to incentivise liqudiity pools on Aerodrome is fitting. 

Because of the short notice of this proposal leading up to Aerodrome's first epoch's end, bribes in this proposal are to be only a one off event, giving the Thales Council sufficient time to devise a longterm Aerodrome bribes program. 

## Specification

Provide 5,000 THALES bribe to the vAMM-USDbC/THALES [pool] 
Provide 5,000 THALES bribe to the vAMM-WETH/THALES [pool]
