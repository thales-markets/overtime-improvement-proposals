## Simple Summary
Enable sizeable bet creation to accomodate markets over 10k USD

## Abstract

Overtime currently can not accomodate large bets over 10k USD and it is limiting our reach for further user aquisition. 

Sizeable bet creation functionality will allow users to challange particular wallets to take the other side of the bet and allow enjoying overtime on sizable amounts as well.

## Motivation

** Current architecture of the overtime markets does not allow us to create sizable bets more than 10k USD 

** Even if its possible its quite risky for the treasury and LP users to take the other side of the bet

** Order books are not possible for sports markets since its not feasible to create and manage order book for each and every sports market which has short lifetime span

## Specification

For us to capture sizable sports bet market we could use current market feed structure as it is and allow for any wallet with a certain criteria to create a Sizable market 
(let say over 10k and approved wallets at the beginning to fine tune the new functionality)

Let say for the market Cleveland Guardians vs Miami Marlins odds are 1.80 vs 1.99 

wallet A bets on Cleveland Guardians for 100k with 1.8 odd, user sends 100k into contract and funds locked in it

System advertise the sizable market on front page to find takers for the other side

Odds locked at market creation and a specific time limit set to take the other side (let say 6 hours )

if %100 of the other side filled before 6 hours lock the contract and resolve the market as is 

if %50 of the other side filled after 6 hours allow wallet A to withdraw %50 of the deposit and rest locked until market resolves

if other side can not accomodate more than %30 of the bid then market forfeited and everybody will be able to withdraw their money fully

We could add additional features like allowing users to whitelist their competitors.

We could charge %1 from overall transaction or if they use over token its without a fee perhaps. 



## Summary

This feature is using current overtime features and not requiring distruptive changes on our infrastructure.

It will allow us to tap into a brand new market and bring us unforseen advertising opporunities (Just think about CT influencers trusting overtime to bet with another account)
